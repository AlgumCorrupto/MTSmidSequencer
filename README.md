<h1><b>That Microtonal Sequencer Project</b></h1>
<h2>NOTE:</h2>
<p><b>Expect stuff to be broken or not to even run if you use this branch!</b></p>
<p>This is because this branch is used to work in new features and due to the fact i'm constantly switching computers and have a very limited to work on the project, stuff may be left most of the times unfinished until i get more time to finish them</p>
